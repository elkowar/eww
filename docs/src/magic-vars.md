# Magic variables

These are variables that are always there, without you having to import them.

The delay between all the updating variables except `EWW_TIME` is 2s, for `EWW_TIME` it is 1s.

There are also `magic constants`, marked with `(Magic constant)` after the variable's name. As the name implies, they do not change.
You can also get them from within your scripts since they are automatically exported as environmental variables!
